The Javascript Library Loader is a toolkit that allows asynchronous loading of 
different Javascript libraries, plugins etc while defining an easy mechanism to
handle inter-library dependencies.

It implements two inner clases that get exposed by public methods:
- ScriptTag: component that injects and loads scripts asynchronously into web pages; 
			 can trigger multiple onload events; 
			 can check for conditions and run alternative logic when that happens
- ScriptDeferrer: component that can load a number of scripts in order,
				  one after another (useful to handle script dependencies)

The component also has a debugging mode which output logs to the console object
available in most modern browsers.
Logging is disabled by default, but can be enabled by running the enableDebug() method.
